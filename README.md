## How to publish?

**Follow this step.**

**_Link the file.html to the CDN for publishing._**

Open the file.html in "View raw" then copy the link URL and paste it into the URL in the first box at the top. 

#### Open here: http://raw.githack.com

Then the second and third URL links will appear, choose which one you want to use to publish. 

**Example below :**

> Use this URL in production. _(Recommended)_

> Use this URL for development.

## Why CDN?

**A content delivery network (CDN) is a way to send content from your files to people more quickly and efficiently, based on their geographic location. A CDN consists of a network of servers ("points of presence," or POPs) in locations around the world. 

The CDN server closest to the user is known as a “edge server” - when people request content from a website sent through a CDN, they are connected to the nearest edge server, ensuring the best possible online experience. 

There are actually other ways to publish/preview the file.html. 

Add and place this URL in the first available URL. 
_"https://htmlpreview.github.io/?"_

An example looks like this.
"https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/username/reponame/main/filename/index.html" 

But for me "CDN" is better than using the method as above.**
